# Backdoors
## what's the Backdoors

## prior work:
- posion training data
- train modele with outsourced-training and model-reuse
## UAPs:
- universal adversarial perturbations
## Limatation
- whereas unmodified mode
## Contribution
- A new vector for backdoor attacks: code poisoning 

## inference-time in deep learning 
Inference time in deep learning refers to the duration it takes for a trained model to make predictions or classifications on new data
- inference-time modification: $Âµ$ must be applied in inference-time
- no inference-time moefication:
